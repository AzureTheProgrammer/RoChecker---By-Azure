Ro Checker - Made by Azure#0263

The best way to find short usernames on Roblox

How does it work?

The script makes a random 3 - 5 letter sequence and checks the made username with the Roblox API to check if it's taken or not.
If the username is available for the taking, it will be added to "names.txt" automatically. 
You can even leave the script running for the text file to collect some names!

How to use this script:

1. Download the file and put it on your desktop in a folder
2. Make a text file called "names" in the same folder
3. Go to command prompt and install requests-html (pip install requests-html)
4. Run the script through command prompt or double click

Enjoy searching for short names !
